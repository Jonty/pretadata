Pretadata
=========
This repository contains data about all 636 Pret A Manger fast food restaurants in the world, and the code used to extract it from their websites.

And [a map](prets.geojson). Look at all those Prets.

Data
----

* Full data is available in [the JSON files](json/)
* [prets.geojson](prets.geojson) is viewable as a map on Github

Other data
----------

* [prets.kml](prets.kml) is an alternative geographic format
* [old_pretadata](old_pretadata/) contains historical 2015 UK Pret data from before their website was changed

Code
----
* Prets in the `uk`, `fr`, `us` are fully extracted from the Pret locations websites by [pretascraper.py](pretascraper.py)
* `hk` data is partial, and lat/lon locations have been automatically geocoded using [pretascraper_hk.py](pretascraper_hk.py)

All other regions have been manually transcribed as they mostly have a single Pret, and all the websites are different.

[prets.geojson](prets.geojson) and [prets.kml](prets.kml) are generated by [generate_mapping_data.py](generate_mapping_data.py).

This data is automatically updated once a month by Github Actions (where possible).
